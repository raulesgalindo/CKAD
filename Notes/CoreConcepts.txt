--Kubernetes Architecture
Node(Minios)
Cluster= Set of nodes

Componentes:
    API Server: Way of communication between CLI, clients to K8s Cluster
    etcd: Keystore, stores all data to manage the cluster,
    schedulre: distribe work on nodes, it looks for newly created containers and assign them to nodes.
    controller: brain behind orchestration, responsible for noticing when nodes, containers or endpoints goes down, they make decisiones to bring up new containers if needed.
    container runtime: docker engine
    kubelet: agent that runs in each node

Master vs Worker Nodes
Worked Node: container runtime(docker, rkgt, cri-o), kubelet
Master: kube api server, etcd, controller, scheduler

kubectl: Kubecontrol
kubectl run hello-minikube
kubctl cluster-info
kubctl get nodes

kubectl delete deployment nginx
kubectl delete pod nginx
kubectl create -f pod-definition.yml
